"""
Logic for setting "args" on a transitioned rule with location expansion.

Compared to "env" and "env_inherit", which are backed by a provider, "args"
handling in Bazel is still based on "magic" handling in the core and thus much
more difficult to generically forward. This results in the following
complexities handled by the functions in this file:

1. The way locations expand in "args" depends on the configuration of the
   underlying target, which can be affected by transitions both by with_cfg.bzl
   and the rule itself. We thus need to obtain the expanded locations from the
   rule context instead of e.g. rewriting labels to helper targets during the
   loading phase, which would miss the effect of transitions applied by the rule
   itself.
   We use a non-recursing aspect on the original rule to collect the files
   corresponding to labels mentioned in location expansion in "args" and provide
   them to the frontend rule via output groups named after the user-provided
   label strings. As a consequence, we also have to set the "args" attribute on
   the underlying target so that the aspect can see it - aspect attributes are
   limited to integers and string enums.
2. "args" can only be set at load time via the magic attribute and the only way
   to get analysis time information into it is via the hard-coded location
   expansion applied to it in
   https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/9425e365ebf921d4286fcf159b429e38f6b0a48f/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/analysis/RunfilesSupport.java#L525
   We create a helper `filegroup` target for each unique label string mentioned
   in a location expansion expression in "args", add it to the (otherwise
   unused) `data` attribute of the frontend and rewrite the label strings to
   instead point to the `filegroup` targets.
3. `native.package_relative_label` is not available in the analysis phase and
   rule or aspect implementation logic can't see the labels of alias targets,
   so the only way to reliably match user-provided labels to the files they
   represent is to query `ctx.expand_location("$(execpaths ...)")` and manually
   collect the files with the given paths.
